# Mini-Library-App

This exercise is an extension of the previous MiniTwitter exercise and consists on implementing JS to create interactive apps. This mini app allows to keep and to add book titles the user is interested on reading, displaying their titles in order from the oldest to the newest addition.

As extra functionality, the app allows the user to delete books, to perform book title searches & to hide the book list on clicking the checkbox.

#Tasks

I created an HTML page in index.html, containing 2 forms with textareas for the search functionality and another one to add books. 

New books will be appended to the upper div, creating both a new title and a delete button when a submit event is detected. 

Clears the area once the book is added to the list.

#Further extensions

Prevent adding the same title.

Tablet and/or desktop versions.

Fetching books from a book API & display them including images, authors, year, plot, etc...

Extend search functionality to allow the user to rerieve books by genere, author, etc...
